#### 4.6.7

An array of n pairs of reals (a_i,b_i) defined the n lines y_i=a_ix+b_i. The lines were ordered in the x-interval [0,1] in the sense that y_i<y_(i+1) for all values  i between 0 and n-2 and all values of x in [0,1]. Given a point (x,y) where 0=<x<=1 determine the two lines that bracket the point.
