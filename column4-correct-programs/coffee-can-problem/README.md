#### 4.6.6

You are initially given a coffee can that contains some black beans and some white beans and a large pile of “extra” black beans. You then repeat the following process until there is a single bean left in the can. Randomly select two beans from the can. If they are the same color, throw them both out and insert an extra black bean. If they are different colors, return the white bean to the can and throw out the black.
Prove that the process terminates and return the color of the final remaining bean.
