After the array x[0..n – 1] is initialized so that every element is zero, n of the following operations are performed

for i = [l, u]
    x[i] += v

where l, u and v are parameters of each operation (l and u are integers satisfying 0 ≤ l ≤ u < n, and v is a real number). After the n operations, the values of x[0..n – 1] are reported in order. The method just sketched requires O(n2) time. Can you find a faster algorithm?
