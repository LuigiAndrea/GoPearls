Subject: Leave of Absence - #1 #2

Dear #3,

As we discussed yesterday, I would like to request a formal leave of absence from my job.
I plan to be away from #4 to #5, returning to work on #6.
I would be available to answer questions and provide assistance while I am away.
Please #3 let me know whether you require any additional information.

Best, #1
