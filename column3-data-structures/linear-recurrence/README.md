#### 3.7.2

A k^th-order linear recurrence with constant coefficients defines a series as 
a_n = c_1 a_(n – 1) + c_2 a_(n – 2) + ... + c_k a_(n–k) + c_(k + 1), where c_1, ..., c_(k + 1) are real numbers. <br/>
Write a program that with input k, a_1 ..., a_k, c_1, ..., c_(k+1), and m produces the output a_1 through a_m.
